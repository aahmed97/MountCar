# MountCar


A solution to the mountain car problem using SARSA with replacing traces and tile coding.
The files tiles3.py to calculate the tile indices and rlglue interface to coordinate agent, experiment, and state
are owned by https://github.com/AmiiThinks/rltoolkit.

Plot part 2: Plots the number of time steps that it takes the car to reach the goal. Observe the fact that it
takes less time steps for the car to reach the goal as the number of episodes increase.


*Updates coming soon*
          ** Planning to add an animation showing in learning during the experiment
